This is an AI bot that can play TicTacToe.
It does so by utilazting the minmax Algorithm to always choose the most optimal move,
in this code two of the same bots play against one anoter and the game always ends in a draw as
both always pick the best move that will lead them to victory.

I've also added a bit of personality to the bots so they would throw quips at one another when making a move.
